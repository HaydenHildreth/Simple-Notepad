# SimpText (formerly SimpleText)
## What is SimpText? 
Simp text is a very light-weight text editor that includes a lot of freedom. This basic text editor works most mainstream Operating Systems, include Windows, MacOS and Linux.
## How do I use SimpText
To compile it you can either clone the repository and build it seperately on your machine via CLI or you can download from the Release page on the GitHub. If you are doing the latter please make sure that it is the latest version.
## More about this project
I made this because I was very bored and wanted to learn more about C++ and QT development of applications. Also, the name was changed from SimpleText to SimpText because Apple company owns all rights to SimpleText as it is the name of their default text editor on MacOS.
## Future development
I'm not entirely sure what is to come for SimpText. Some things I am wanting to implement, StyleSheets, User Configs and in general just more user customization/the ability for the user to change everything.
